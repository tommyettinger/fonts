# fonts
Storage for AngelCode BMFont (.fnt) files. Works with libGDX.

Most of these fonts were made with the AngelCode BMFont tool, some were made with libGDX' Hiero tool, and some were made by my own tool Glamer.
I'm not perfectly happy with any of these, and many will need small adjustments to be properly legible.
They should be fine if you just need a font that can be scaled down to moderately-small sizes, but you don't know exactly what size you will need.
There are regular old "standard" bitmap fonts here, as well as "sdf" signed distance field fonts and "msdf" multi-channel signed distance field fonts.
You probably want "standard" unless you know your tools support sdf or msdf.

# Icons and Emoji

There are also some emoji here from Twemoji and OpenMoji, as well as icons from game-icons.net . These can be used from TextraTypist or loaded as a libGDX .atlas file in other formats. If you aren't using libGDX, you can unpack the atlas using https://github.com/tommyettinger/libgdx-texturepacker or a menu option in https://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-texture-packer-gui to get the individual files. I also have repos where the intermediate files are stored as separate files already: https://github.com/tommyettinger/twemoji-atlas , https://github.com/tommyettinger/openmoji-atlas , and https://github.com/tommyettinger/game-icons-net-atlas .

# Licenses

The license for each font, or more accurately the .png image that uses the copyrighted font file, is in a file with the same prefix as the image and a file extension of .txt or .md .
Most of these fonts have OFL licenses. All are free to use for commercial purposes, to the best of my knowledge.
